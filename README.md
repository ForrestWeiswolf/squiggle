# Squiggle

This is an experiment DSL/language for making probabilistic estimates.

## DistPlus 
We have a custom library called DistPlus to handle distributions with additional metadata. This helps handle mixed distributions (continuous + discrete), a cache for a cdf, possible unit types (specific times are supported), and limited domains.

## Running

Currently it only has a few very simple models.

```
yarn
yarn run start
yarn run parcel
```

## Expected future setup
