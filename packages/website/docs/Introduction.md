Squiggle is a simple programming language for intuitive probabilistic estimation. It's meant for quantitative forecasting and evaluations.

The basics of Squiggle can be pretty simple and intuitive. The more advanced functionality can take some time to learn.

## What Squiggle Is
- A simple programming language for doing math with probability distributions
- An embeddable language that can be used in Javascript applications
- A tool to embed functions as forecasts that can be embedded in other applications

## What Squiggle Is Not
- A complete replacement for enterprise Risk Analysis tools (See Crystal Ball, @Risk, Lumina Analytica)
- A Probabilistic Programming Language with backwards inference and sophisticated sampling algorithms. (See [PPLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming))
- A visual tool aimed at casual users (see Guesstimate, Causal)
