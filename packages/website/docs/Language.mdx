# Squiggle Language

The squiggle language has a very simple syntax. The best way to get to understand
it is by simply looking at examples.

## Basic Language 

As an example:

<SquiggleEditor initialSquiggleString={`value_of_work = 10 to 70
value_of_work`} />

Squiggle can declare variables (`value_of_work = 10 to 70`) and declare exports
(the lone `value_of_work` line). Variables can be used later in a squiggle program
and even in other notebooks! 

An export is rendered to the output view so you can see your result.

the exports can be expressions, such as:

<SquiggleEditor initialSquiggleString="normal(0,1)" />

## Functions

Squiggle supports functions, including the rendering of functions:

<SquiggleEditor initialSquiggleString={`ozzie_estimate(t) = lognormal({mean: 3 + (t+.1)^2.5, stdev: 8})
ozzie_estimate
`} />
