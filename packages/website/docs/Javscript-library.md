There's a very simple javscript library for Squiggle here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/squiggle-experimental.

You can see it live on this Observable page: [https://observablehq.com/d/a99e822870c4ca5f](https://observablehq.com/d/a99e822870c4ca5f).


## Simple Example
```
let squiggle = require("squiggle-experimental@0.1.9/dist/index.js")
squiggle.runMePlease("3 + normal(50,1))
```
