# Squiggle For VS Code

_[marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=QURI.vscode-squiggle)_

This extension provides support for [Squiggle](https://www.squiggle-language.com/) in VS Code.

# Build locally

We assume you ran `yarn` at the monorepo level for all dependencies.

Then, simply `yarn compile` at the `vscode-ext` package level. It will build `squiggle-lang`, `squiggle-components`, and the VS Code extension source code.
