\section{Squiggle: the current document}

The current document is a formal description of the syntax that Squiggle will target in it's alpha release, scheduled for Q3 2022. It is initially drafted for consumption by the team, not by the user base.

For an informal story of what we are about to see, consult \cite{@SqgCodePlan}.

We proceed by a BNF (\cite{@BNFWiki}), and take nods about how to communicate about programming languages from \cite{@CraftingInterpreters}, neglecting lessons from \cite{@PFPL}.

\subsection{Design goals}

We would like, as a programming language, a \textbf{specification} for \textit{expressing beliefs}.

One key difference between this vision and probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) is that for us, the ingest of data is not a factor. See discussion with John Wentworth in \cite{@SqgSequence} for background on the PPL comparison.
